# Data-Augmantation-for-improving-radar-point-cloud-classification-
 The objective of this project is to explore and evaluate the impact of data augmentation
 techniques on radar point cloud classification. Specifically, the goals are to:
 
 • Implement data augmentation technique such as Gaussien noise
 injection on tabular radar point cloud data to solve imbalanced data problem.
 
 • Assess the effectiveness of these techniques in improving the classification perfor
mance of machine learning models.

 • Compare the classification results with and without data augmentation to under
stand its impact

I used VoD dataset and machine learning models SVM, KNN,Fine TREE MODEL on matlab.
